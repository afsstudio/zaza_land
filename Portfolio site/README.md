# Zaza Land Portfolio

Welcome to **Zaza Land**, an interactive, gamified portfolio website designed by **Aaron Simmons**. I built this using anti-gravity and gemini 3 pro flash. All of the icons and assets I designed myself by hand the old fashioned way. I get tired of how most portfolios look like fancy restaurant menus, so I figured I'd switch it up. 

In this site you can explore my work by going to the 5 different project locations, collect cool gems to learn neat facts about me, and read some of my comics that are included as the backdrop for the site. 
- **Explore** a vast interactive map.
- **Collect Gems** to unlock secrets.
- **Visit Project Locations** to learn about my work.
- **Interact** using keyboard controls (Arrow Keys + E/R) or on-screen touch controls.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Move**: Arrow Keys / WASD / Drag on screen
- **Interact**: 'E' key / Tap 'E' button
- **Secrets**: 'R' key / Tap 'R' button (Requires Gems)

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Game loop, collision detection, state management, and UI interactions.
- **No External Libraries**: Built completely from scratch for maximum performance and control.
